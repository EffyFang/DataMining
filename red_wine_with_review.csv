Kudos to winemaker Peter Rosback for finding great Pinot all over Oregon. This unique vineyard shows classic varietal fruit laced with mineral, kissed with toast, and finished with delicious mocha flavors from new oak barrels. The tart, tangy spine keeps it balanced and extends the fruit flavors well into a long, crisp finish."

It's also pretty tannic. Keenan's regular '02 is actually more rewarding, and I don't think this rather ungainly Reserve will surpass it."

Argentino in 2007 is deep and dark like always, with coconut and cassis aromas preceding a sweet, ultrarich palate that's teetering on candied. Quite oaky and chocolaty as well, with brown sugar and depth to the finish. Drink now through 2014."

Cured meat, match stick and pineapple-lemon aromas work their way onto the mildly oaky nose, while the palate has a vanilla-based lushness that works well. Rich, opulent and classy. A sincere food wine."

The wine is also aged in oak for aromas of spice and toast that appear behind the mature fruit. Overall, it is solid and dense with ripe tannins."

To further distinguish it from ordinary Beaujolais, it's fairly full-bodied and shows tea-like tannins on the finish."

Made of the five classic Bordeaux varieties, it's full-bodied, dry and richly tannic. The flavors are enormously complex, suggesting blackberries, cassis, olive tapenade and cedar, with a long, sweet finish. Already throwing some sediment, it should age well for the next ten years."

The immediate aroma is of vanilla and toast, while the palate experience is of oak and dry tannins that numb the palate through the finish. There is a core of blackberry fruit that is solid and dense, the result of very low yields. This pricy wine is not drinkable now, unless you're not fussy.

And yet the wine has old vine character, and ages beautifully, more like a Bordeaux than anything from this country. It's a fine bottle to tuck away into the cellar. Right now, the grapey, slightly plummy fruit and dried herbs are not entirely integrated."

Arnaud Margaine works each harvest to create freshness and a totally crisp texture, generally dismissing malolactic fermentation. It is balanced, allowing the fruitiness to shine through the tight, mineral texture from the predominant Chardonnay in the blend that comes from a mere 16-acre Montaigne de Reims vineyard surrounded by Pinot Noir.

Nothing quite like it anywhere, with its inky dark color, big, thick tannins and ripe, exuberant flavors of berries, currants, mocha, leather, tobacco, cedar and peppery spices.

Bearing Gina Gallo's signature, it's a fine Cabernet, soft, dry and complex, with flavors of blackberry, black currant and cedar.

Air allows it to unfold and show boysenberry and plum flavors, while the feel is creamy, syrupy and flush.

It's consistent with previous efforts and reminiscent of Reininger—satiny smooth, glossy and somewhat impenetrable.

The acidity, ripe blackcurrants sit comfortably on top of dry tannins, the fleshiness of the fruit taking the edge off the tannins.

The fruit expression is pure and powerful, an intense burst of raspberry and cranberry, anchored in mineral and chalk. Only neutral oak was used, so the fruit is framed beautifully by the acids and tannins, and it is so pure and resonant that it is hard to believe that this wine won't age beautifully for a decade or more."

There's no denying the quality of the 2001, which boasts bold aromas of toast, cedar, vanilla and blackberries. The mouthfeel is full, creamy and lush, and while it finishes a touch sweet, there's just enough tannin and acid to keep it balanced. Delicious now, but these wines can age 10 or more years from the vintage."

Dusty earth, cedar, cola and plum notes mingle easily, but seem a bit reined in. Shows good length, auguring well for improvement over the next five years. Drink 2010-2018."

What sets it apart from similar California efforts is that it retains natural acids and some lovely herbal highlights, so it's not just a hot, heavy, alcoholic date—the sort that breathes in your ear and leaves you exhausted but somehow unsatisfied. If you like big, brawny Zin, but want some structure along with it, this is a fine choice. Drink up."
