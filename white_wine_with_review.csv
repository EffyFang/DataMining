From organically grown grapes, the wine has a smooth taste of wild strawberry and is not overly complex, the finish abbreviated and the wine on the lower price range of the variety."

It offers nuanced aromas of spice, tobacco, vanilla and savory notes that are followed by plentiful, palate-coating red and blue-fruit flavors that extend out through a long, fruit and spice-filled finish.

In this bottling he blends co-fermented lots of 60% Syrah and 40% Grenache from Bien Nacido and Murmur vineyards to produce aromas reminiscent of venison in a rainbow peppercorn glaze, with touches of tar and crushed graphite.

The 1997 is modern in style, exhibiting huge but not too-dominant wood aromas and flavors, balancing with sweet, ripe berry fruit and black cherry jam. This is a wine that should be accessible young in four or five years, but should certainly age well over the following 10 or more."

The fruit lies over the subtle wood aging that has smoothed the crisp texture. The wine is still young and will be best from 2021.

There's freshness as well, with fruit acidity that cuts through the mineral texture. Drink from 2018."
