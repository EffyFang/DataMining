It's not just cookie-cutter ripe and rich, but instead shows herbs, mushroom and also ample black plum and berry flavors. In general it's nice for those seeking a touch more from their Argentinean Malbec. And it hails from lesser-known San Juan and not Mendoza, which may explain its unusual characteristics."

There's noticeable acid and some interesting grace notes, suggestive of flint and gun metal. The flavors linger pleasantly in the back of the throat.

Rich and fruity in the mouth, it's a complex mix of melon, passion fruit, papaya, guava and sweet orange. The fruit salad rolls back into oaky, buttery flavors for a full-throttle finish. Another 15.5% effort from Airfield, but here the fruit can stand up to the barrels."

At 13.6% alcohol it is in fine balance, with a precise mix of strawberry, pie cherry, root beer and herb flavors. It's medium bodied, open and accessible, but not too simple.

The palate brings out more earthiness but also pits the notions of mellow baked apple against absolutely tart lemon freshness. Stone and earth cling constantly to these flavors and draw you in. The palate is pure and slender, totally dry and taut. The finish is of lasting lemon zest. This needs time but is full of promise. Drink 2020–2035."

It's certainly a big wine that floods the mouth with blackberry, black currant, cassis and new oak flavors. The tannins and acids make it aloof, resistant, tough. It wants time in the cellar. Best after 2013. Production was a hefty 13,500 cases."

The feral, exotic flavors of pine cones, wild herbs, tea, raspberries and cola suggest the Fort Ross area. There's an exciting complexity and challenge to this wine.

Bright, tart, ripe and compact red-berry fruit is set against firm, polished tannins. Still young and hard, it needs plenty of breathing time, or better yet, cellar it for a few years.

The fruit is fantastically concentrated, suggesting cherries and black raspberries baked into a pie—pie crust, and dusting of cinnamon sugar and cocoa included.

With a drop of Petit Verdot, it's young and jammy, explosive in black currant and chocolate flavors, with plenty of smoky oak. Although the tannins are big, they're completely ripe and sweet. Four-plus years of age have softened them. Drink this Cabernet Sauvignon now with very upscale foods, and it should hold and soften for a decade."

It's strong and astringent in tannins and potent in ripe, fruity blackberries and plums, with a spicy edge of smoked bacon.

Words like opulent and elegant come to mind to describe intense flavors of black cherries, licorice, cola, herb tea and Indian spices. It's bone dry, and also quite tannic, but you can enjoy it now with big, rich lamb and beef dishes, or a wild mushroom risotto. Otherwise, it will continue to improve for at least eight years."

The 2008 Merlot includes 5% each Cabernet Sauvignon and Cab Franc.

There's plenty of barrel influence, from 70% new French oak, but it's welcome, and appropriate, perfectly matched to the power of the fruit.

A celebrated star of the Veneto, this oak-aged red offers enormous density and intensity, with soft, velvety layers and bright aromas of red fruit, spice and dried sage. The finish is characterized by savory, herbal notes that are fresh and tantalizing."

This version of Cirsion, one of our very favorite modern Riojas, is relatively soft, raisiny and simple, and for that it doesn't quite rate with some of the past vintages, which were spectacular. But that doesn't mean you won't love the wine's smooth texture, cocoa and baked berry flavors, and its overall generous character. Drink now through 2010."

Half of the grapes are estate-grown, half are from the Pepper Bridge vineyard. The smooth, chocolatey nose is a Woodward trademark and, despite its youth, the wine has a satiny mouthfeel. Polished, saturated fruit is set off with restrained new oak, and leads to a silky, seamless, satisfying finish. Just 247 cases made."

Using grapes sourced from the high-density Monte Lodoletta vineyard, this inky, dark expression oozes with syrupy tones of maraschino, dark chocolate fudge, cinnamon spice, crushed clove and barbecue smoke. In keeping with the wine's legendary reputation for long aging potential, the tannins are rock solid at the moment."

The veil of ripeness carries to the palate, but it proves more serious and restrained, with graphite minerality, bergamot and sage elements. It's complex and yet easily enjoyable."

Although it is full of black currant fruits and spice flavors, the texture is most impressive. Dusty tannins are integrated with juicy fruits seamlessly. The purest fruit flavors are allied to linear tannins in a precise yet generous way. The wine is evolving beautifully, but do not drink before 2020."

In the mouth, it has a molten quality, like liquid lead or mercury; strong flavors of plums, bitter chocolate, cassis, and good, rich oak. Pretty astringent now in tannins, it's firm and hard, but complex and layered. Drink now, but best beyond 2010."

Dry, smooth and silky, it defines Pinot's more Burgundian side, with mushroomy notes along with perfectly ripe cherries and raspberries, accented with brilliant acidity. The oak treatment is tasteful and blends in seamlessly, offering a hint of toast. The wine treads an exciting line between ripeness and earthiness, while keeping alcohol to a refreshingly low 14.1%. This is a connoisseur's wine."

The play of flavors, mixing red and purple fruits, toasted nuts, mocha, caramel, bark and earth, is exceptional. The detail is extraordinary for a wine with such high alcohol. The acids and tannins are seamless and fine, and the flavors extend into an unusual finish that suggests menthol and eucalyptus – not generally a character found in Champoux fruit. All in all it's a wonderful voyage, and one of a handful of essential Washington wines."

This is an exuberant wine with thickly extracted notes of coffee bean, blackberry, leather and savory layers of black pepper. The wine is rich, smooth and velvety and will appeal less to Nebbiolo traditionalists."

Flavors reminiscent of an ice cream sundae work the palate, which means berry syrup, chocolate sauce and vanilla are highly prominent. Texturally speaking, this is a smooth, soft and plush wine.

As such, it's wonderfully balanced, with a sprightly burst of acidity brightening succulent flavors of black cherry and dark chocolate. The use of 100% new French oak sounds excessive on paper, but it's perfectly integrated, providing a jacket of sweet buttered toast that in no way overshadows the fruit.

When first released the wine seemed to have entered a dumb phase, but six months later it responds to decanting and shows its muscle. Fruit flavors of black, brandied cherries, cassis and bourbon-soaked plums are wrapped in generous, layered oak. The wine is dusty, smoky, laced with streaks of licorice and brightened with sharp acids. It continues to expand further in the glass, adding flesh and spice to its frame, with a cedar/cigar box finish."

Utterly delicious, with a silky, briskly clean mouthfeel. But the tannins are pronounced. They're not so strong as to lock the wine down, but do suggest time in the cellar.
